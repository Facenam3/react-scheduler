A Full-Stack Task Scheduler built with **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **LocalStorage**.  
This project allows users to add, update, and track tasks for specific dates with a **responsive mobile-friendly interface**.

## About

I built this project while learning React. Initially, I created a simple to-do application to organize my daily tasks.  
After experimenting with **useState** and **component logic**, I realized I could expand it into a more complete scheduler.  
Now, this app helps manage daily tasks, shows completed vs. pending tasks, and works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
